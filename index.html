    <div class="box"><h3>THE HISTORY OF HTML</h3></div>
	<div class="parabox"><p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages.<br> 
        It was first developed in the late 1980s by a physicist named Tim Berners-Lee, who was working <br>
        at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. Berners-Lee created the first web <br>
        browser and web server, as well as the first HTML specification, which was released in 1991.</p>
	<p>Over the years, HTML has gone through several versions, with each new version introducing new<br>
         features and capabilities. HTML 2.0 was released in 1995, followed by HTML 3.2 in 1997 and <br>
         HTML 4.01 in 1999. HTML5, the current version of HTML, was first introduced in 2008 and has <br>
         since become widely adopted by web developers around the world.</p>
	<p>Today, HTML is an essential component of web development, and is used in conjunction with CSS <br>
        and JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive web pages. Its history reflects the evolution <br>
        of the web, and its ongoing development ensures that it will continue to play a critical role <br>
        in shaping the future of the internet.</p>
